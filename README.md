This is a project that I have created some time ago, but haven't published on GitHub.

The project's name is pretty self-explanatory, though it was not meant to be a real reaction test. I created it, generally, for fun, while also gaining a lot of knowledge of how to use React hooks in a, somewhat, real project.

Results you get, in no means are the representation of your real reaction time. I have ideas of how I could improve this react app, but, at the time being, I'll leave it in a state it is right now. It was a great way to practice what I've learned in tutorials.
